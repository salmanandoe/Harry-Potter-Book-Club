    ('Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone','https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkWXbfQrO5oTm1I5izjeRTbQD-vKPnybT24S2kFw2eH8LyyCo5','Harry Potter is the most miserable, lonely boy you can imagine. Hes shunned by his relatives, the Dursleys, who have raised him since he was an infant. Hes forced to live in the cupboard under the stairs, forced to wear his cousin Dudleys hand-me-down clothes, and forced to go to his neighbours house when the rest of the family is doing something fun. Yes, hes just about as miserable as you can get. Harrys world gets turned upside down on his 11th birthday, however. A magical half-giant, Hagrid, informs Harry that hes really a wizard, and will soon be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry also learns that, in the wizarding world, hes a hero. When he was an infant, the evil Lord Voldemort killed his parents and then tried to kill Harry too. Whats so amazing to everyone is that Harry survived, and allegedly destroyed Voldemort in the process. When Harry hears all this, he doesnt know what to think. However, everything Hagrid tells him turns out to be true, and with a joyful heart Harry starts wizarding school in September. He quickly becomes best friends with a boy named Ron Weasley, and before they even make it to Christmas, they break tons of school rules when they attack a troll and prevent it from killing fellow student Hermione Granger. After the troll incident, the three become inseparable, and Harry is amazed to have found such great friends. He is constantly busy trying to stay on top of the mounds of homework, as well as participating in weekly Quidditch practices. Quidditch is a popular sport among wizards and Harry is the youngest Quidditch player in over a century. Its also a game Harry loves more than anything else at school. As the year progresses, the three friends set out to solve the mystery of the gigantic three-headed dog that is guarding something in a deserted corridor in the school. They figure out that a very valuable object, the Sorcerers Stone, is being hidden in the school, although they dont know why. When one of the professors starts acting as if hes trying to steal it, they quickly take action to circumvent the theft. Things come to a head when they sneak past the vicious, three-headed dog and go down into the bowels of the school, determined to save the stone. Ron and Hermione help Harry get through the challenges set forth to stop the thief, but Harry must go on alone to battle the professor. When he finally gets to the last room, however, hes astonished to find someone else entirely. Harry is forced to do battle with the wizard that tried to kill him so many years before, Lord Voldemort. Hes able to save the Sorcerers Stone, although hes almost killed in process. The school headmaster, Dumbledore, arrives just in time to save Harry. The school year ends spectacularly. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are honored for their service to the school, and Harry leaves to go back to the Dursleys for the summer feeling as if hes finally found a place where he really belongs.');

    ('Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets','https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyDaN5FijaQ_3OuhFtfYLkXDkAfv07RnKNiNwUzbvOjAE2V9EQ','Its been another long summer at the Dursleys for Harry Potter. He cant wait to get back to Hogwarts and is counting down the days until he can return. Hes surprised when, on his birthday, a strange selfish creature named Dobby shows up with dire warnings for Harry: He must not return to Hogwarts!
    When Harry refuses to stay home from school, Dobby lands him in heaps of trouble with the Dursleys, who lock Harry up in his room and refuse to let him out. Before Harry can sink too far into despair, however, Ron Weasley and his two brothers, twins Fred and George, come to his rescue in a flying car and spirit him back to their house, where Harry is thrilled to spend the remainder of the summer.
    Thus starts an eventful second year for Harry Potter. Between having to cope with more homework than ever, a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor who is vain and convinced Harry is too, and a mysterious voice he keeps hearing in the walls, Harrys days are nothing if not interesting.As the school year progresses, however, the mysterious voice Harry keeps hearing is getting more and more menacing, and soon vicious attacks start happening to the students of Hogwarts. When Harry discovers, quite by accident, that he is a Parslemouth and can speak to snakes, hes quickly singled out as Slytherins heir, the person who, according to legend, will open the mysterious “Chamber of Secrets” and release the monster within.
    Of course Harry has no idea who is attacking the students, but he quickly resolves to find out who is responsible. He, Ron, and Hermione come up with an elaborate plan to disguise themselves as Slytherin students so they can question Draco Malfoy, whom they believe is the one setting the monster loose in the school. The plan goes perfectly, but theyre disappointed when they find out from Draco that he is not the one theyre looking for.
    The quest gets personal when Hermione is attacked and petrified by the monster. Ron and Harry are devastated, and are left on their own to uncover the true identity of the person responsible. Events come to a head when Rons sister, Ginny, is kidnapped and taken down into the Chamber of Secrets, and Ron and Harry discover an important clue that Hermione left for them. They quickly head down into the Chamber of Secrets to rescue Ginny. Harry and Ron get separated once theyre down there and Harry is left to pursue the monster on his own. He quickly finds Ginny, and thanks to some mysterious help from Dumbledore and his pet phoenix, Fawkes, Harry is able to destroy Slytherins heir, who turns out to be a younger version of Lord Voldemort. Voldemort had possessed Ginny through an enchanted diary and was using her to set the monster loose on the students.
    Harry and Ron are both hailed as heroes when they make it back out with Ginny, and Harry cant imagine a finer end to such an eventful year when Hermione and the rest of the victims are healed and they win Gryffindor loads of House points.');

    ('Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban','https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRDQUcqEVnm1TSGF_Mejt9_Tctl8Wh0rUcRRs_Icr2YlUTv6lZB','Harry starts off his third year at Hogwarts rather eventfully when he inadvertently blows up his Aunt Marge, goes on the run, and is then personally absolved by the Minister of Magic himself. He then learns that mass murderer, Sirius Black, is intent on killing him, and Mr. Weasley makes him promise a strange thing, that no matter what he hears he wont go looking for Black. Confused, Harry agrees.
    As he heads back to school armed with this knowledge, he learns that dementors, evil, soul-sucking creatures, have been stationed around Hogwarts to protect the students from Black. The dementors affect Harry much more than the other students because of his terrible past, and he quickly resolves to learn to defend himself when he begins collapsing every time they come near. He finds a willing teacher in Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, who begins teaching Harry the Patronus Charm, which is the only spell that will work against the foul creatures. As the school year progresses, the third year students are buried under piles of homework. Hermione is already stressed out due to her enormous course load, and none of them can figure out how shes getting to all her classes. It doesnt help that Hermiones cat, Crookshanks, repeatedly tries to eat Rons rat, Scabbers, causing the two friends to argue ceaselessly about the animals. They stop speaking entirely when its discovered that Crookshanks seems to have eaten Scabbers and Ron is devastated.
    Harry has a few close calls with Black when he breaks into the castle, but Black is not apprehended. Things come to a climax as the school year ends when a number of events occur. First, Rons rat, Scabbers, turns out to still be alive and is really a wizard in disguise. This wizard, Peter Pettigrew, has chosen to hide himself in this way so that he can spy on Harry and his friends on behalf of Lord Voldemort. Harry learns that it was Peter, and not Sirius Black, that betrayed his parents to Voldemort. Just when Harry is sure Peter is finally going to be punished for his crimes, he escapes into the night. Sirius, long thought to be a mass murderer and Voldemort supporter, turns out to be innocent. Harry also learns that Sirius is his godfather. Hes overjoyed when, for a moment, he thinks he might be finally free of the Dursleys and able to live with Sirius, but Sirius has to go on the run from the Ministry to avoid being apprehended.
    Professor Lupin, Harrys favorite teacher, ends up resigning his post when its discovered that hes a werewolf. He narrowly avoids attacking the kids, and its Sirius that saves their lives when he turns into a huge shaggy dog to protect them.
    Its an action-packed year to be sure, but Harry is very happy that Sirius makes it out safely and is finally free from Azkaban. Hes comforted by the fact that he finally has a family-member, so to speak, out there watching over him.');
